An application to keep track of employee timesheets
I used windows forms to develop an employee tracking timesheets
application. The application can be used in user mode or in admin
mode. In admin mode, the administrator can set one of the default
gates through which the employee enters. In user mode, the
employee can enter their ID number or name to identify
themselves in the list of employees and register on arrival or
departure.
